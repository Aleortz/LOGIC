# LOGIC: Prolog Labs for Learning Mathematical and Computational Logic

Welcome to the **LOGIC** repository, a space dedicated to practicing and learning mathematical and computational logic using Prolog. This resource supports students in developing logical reasoning and problem-solving skills through hands-on labs, guided by Ph.D Israel Pineda.

Explore each lab to build knowledge in logic, rule-based systems, and expert system design.
